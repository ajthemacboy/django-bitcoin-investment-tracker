# django-bitcoin-investment-tracker
Simple Django project to track Bitcoin investments

This was a simple project to help me learn Django. 

It uses a database to store investment entries, containing the date, time, original price per token, and the number of tokens. The entries are displayed sorted by date, and show the current worth and the worth change based on the current price per token. The entry page also displays the current price per token, total worth, and total worth change. The entry page has buttons to edit and delete the entry.
